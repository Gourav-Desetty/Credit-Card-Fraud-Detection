# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model trained on real-world, anonymized data. It tackles the challenge of class imbalance to improve fraud detection accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Model Highlights

- Real-world dataset with extreme class imbalance
- Used undersampling for balancing the dataset
- Trained using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
